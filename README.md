# bootcamp-project01
Bootcamp First Project
Requirements:

Create a new index.html file, just like the last project, and set up the basic doc structure

Set up the page with three primary sections: header, main, and footer:

Use an `<h1>` tag in the header to add the company name, and a `<nav>` tag with some nav links.

Add a `<section>` tag to the main content,

Add a background image to the feature section

Absolute positioning the titles

I covered all the requirements

I found it most difficult to get flexboxes and images to do what i wanted

once i have gotten the hang of css selectors, i realise how powerful they can be
using attributes it made doing what i wanted a lot easier

useful external resources i used was google w3schools and stackoverflow and moodle

the two main errors i have had was with image sizing in flexboses, i ended up switching to absolute positioning to fix that.

also due to the way i designed my page, resizing the window would break how it looked, in hindsight it was a bad way to design it the way i did, but i "fixed" it using code

so far i am most pleased with the active icon/nav bar and how they change colour depending on their element as well as if they are active or not.
