# bootcamp-project01
Bootcamp First Project
Requirements:

Create a new index.html file, just like the last project, and set up the basic doc structure

Set up the page with three primary sections: header, main, and footer:

Use an `<h1>` tag in the header to add the company name, and a `<nav>` tag with some nav links.

Add a `<section>` tag to the main content,

Add a background image to the feature section

Absolute positioning the titles

I covered all the requirements

I found it most difficult to get flexboxes and images to do what i wanted
